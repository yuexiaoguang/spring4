/**
 * HTTP request handler that exports the specified service bean as
 * Burlap service endpoint, accessible via a Burlap proxy.
 * Designed for Sun's JRE 1.6 HTTP server, implementing the
 * {@link com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler} interface.
 *
 * <p>Burlap is a slim, XML-based RPC protocol.
 * For information on Burlap, see the
 * <a href="http://www.caucho.com/burlap">Burlap website</a>.
 * This exporter requires Burlap 3.x.
 *
 * <p>Note: Burlap services exported with this class can be accessed by
 * any Burlap client, as there isn't any special handling involved.
 *
 * @deprecated as of Spring 4.0, since Burlap hasn't evolved in years
 * and is effectively retired (in contrast to its sibling Hessian)
